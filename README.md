# RealityCheck AI

**RealityCheck AI** is a public, zero-trust lab for **AGI / ASI / CI skeptics and curious newcomers**.

- Watch claims get scored on **coherence (κ)**, **future responsibility (τ)**, and **risk (Σ)**  
- Learn why super-scale intelligence isn’t automatically scary — and when it *should* be  
- Explore live, browser-only demos: no logins, no tracking, no hidden backend
